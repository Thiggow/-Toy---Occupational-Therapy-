# Occupational Therapy Toy
## 1. Introduction
Due to certain physical and sensory limitations, some children have difficulties in obtaining certain experiences that are of utmost importance for their development and well-being, such as contact with animals. Therefore, it is necessary that there are toys that have been thought out and designed to provide such contact and learning in an adapted and functional way.

## 2. Goal
The present work had the proposal to develop a toy whose target audience would be children with Chronic Non-Progressive Encephalopathy (visual impairment) and/or cerebral palsy. Thus, using the theme ''Farm'', I developed a device that contains two interactive animals (made in a 3D printer), two levers and two buttons that, when pressed, emit lights and sounds similar to the respective animal.

## 4. Operation Description
The child can play with the buttons or with the levers that will be connected to the arduino and will make the leds light up and activate the DFPlayer mp3 module, thus emitting the sound of each animal and illuminating it.

## 5. Hardware and Software Requirements
To develop the toy, the Arduino UNO R3 system was used, along with:
- Protoboard;
- Jumpers;
- Buttons;
- Leds;
- Sensor Touch;
- 1.5v batteries;
- DFPlayer mini mp3 module;
- Micro SD Card;
- Speaker;
- Resistors.

For the operation of the toy, the Arduino was programmed in C++ language.
